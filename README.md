Then you can run: /br
`npm test -- --coverage` to see the percentage of coverage \
Sometimes, you maybe need to run: \
`npm test --coverage --watchAll=false`  \
or `($env:CI = "true") -and (npm test)`  \
If there are some words "No tests found related to files changed since last commit.", 
please insert some empty space in any part, then run `npm test -- --coverage` or `npm test --coverage --watchAll=false` again.
